## Website-Recon-and-Footprinting

- **Lookup an IP address for a website:** Can use the 'host' DNS lookup utility in Kali. If there's multiple IPs associated the site might be using a proxy like Cloudflare.
```
host website.com
```

- **Find pages and directories**: Websites should have two publicly accessible files for search engine crawlers normally stored on the root of the website:
	1. **robots.txt**  (```https://website/robots.txt```) - Tells search engine web crawlers what they're allowed to crawl or what not to crawl like hidden directories. 
	2. **sitemap.xml** (```https://website/sitemap.xml```) - Tells search engines pages that they want to index
- Another way to get some information like a name or socials is from navigating through the site itself.
- **Find website technologies** - Websites addons/extensions to get website technologies, frameworks, CMS and programming languages:
	- **BuiltWith** ( [https://builtwith.com/](https://builtwith.com/)  | Website and Addon)
	- **Wappalyzer** ( [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/wappalyzer/](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/wappalyzer/) | Extension) - Can show frameworks, CMS and programming languages 
	- **Netcraft** ([https://sitereport.netcraft.com/](https://sitereport.netcraft.com/)): Netcraft has an all-in-one tool that can be used for getting domain information, getting website technologies and any background/network information which will be useful. Can also look at ssl/tls which can tell you when the certificate will resolve.	
	- **whatweb** - Free built-in website scanner in Kali  

```
whatweb https://www.website.com
```

- **Download a copy of a website** - Can use HTTrack Website copier to download the website and linked resources  to view the source code and technologies involved.  Can download the HTTrack package in kali, by default it runs the webserver on port 8080.
```
sudo apt-get install webhttrack
```

## WhoIs-Enumeration

WHOIS is a protocol for querying databases to find ownership details of domain names and IP addresses. You can use this information to get information on individuals like names/phone numbers/locations etc which is good for phishing or to get name servers.  Kali has a ```whois``` utility built-in to Kali:
```
whois company.com
```
Other tools to get WhoIs:
- [virustotal.com](http://virustotal.com)
- [domaintools.com](http://domaintools.com)

## DNS-Recon

**Goal:** Identify various DNS records especially A records, MX records for the server IP, TXT, and NS servers to get an idea of how a website is configured. 

1. **DNSRecon** is a python script that can be used enumerate DNS records for a given domain like MX, SOA, NS, A, AAAA, SPF, and TXT. It comes pre-packaged in Kali:

```
dnsrecon -d company.com
```
	
2. **DNSDumpster** ([https://dnsdumpster.com/](https://dnsdumpster.com/)): A free web tool that can find DNS records and possibly live hosts associated with a domain. This tools can perform active and passive reconnaissance through the website. A great thing about the website is that it does a great job mapping the servers/IP with their diagrams.
	- You can find hosts sharing the listed DNS server
	- In some cases, you might find a subdomain which can return a live page.
	- You can export to a diagram which can show IPs associated with whatever company its associated with.
	- You can perform Nmap scans on any observed servers (website) but it will be active

## WAF

You can use ```wafwoof``` which comes pre-packaged in Kali linux to check if a website or web application has a WAF solution deployed. This is still passive information gathering, but the only way to confirm if there is a WAF solution is to perform active information gathering like port scanning. The ```-a``` parameter can look for all instances of WAF solutions

```
wafwoof website.com
```

## Hunting-Subdomains

1. **Sublist3r** | [https://github.com/aboul3la/Sublist3r](https://github.com/aboul3la/Sublist3r) | A subdomain search tool thatâ€™s good for going 1 subdomain deep for a domain search but can find subdomains multiple levels deep. It currently doesn't come pre-packaged in Kali so it need to be installed manually:

```
sudo apt install sublist3r
```

- How to use Sublist3r:

```
sublister -d domain.com
```

- Note 1: If Sublist3r is running slow:

```
sublist3r -d domain.com -t 100
```

- Note 2: Some search engines like Google does rate-limiting, so it can start blocking requests when you hit the request threshold. You can circumvent this with a VPN.

- **[Crt.sh](http://Crt.sh)** ( [https://crt.sh/](https://crt.sh/) )- Web tool does a search for certifications for a domain/org . This can be pretty good for finding subdomains multiple levels deep (ie ```subdomain2.subdomain1.domain.com``` )

- **OWASP Amass** - [https://github.com/owasp-amass/amass](https://github.com/owasp-amass/amass) - the more common tool for finding more subdomains than sublist3r can. Can use this tool instead for subdomain searches  though the search can take a while.

## Google-Dorks

**Google Dorking** is a technique used to find sensitive information or vulnerabilities on websites by using advanced search operators in Google to expose subdomains and possibly sensitive information such as login credentials, database details, or configuration files.

**Possible Google Queries/Parameters**:
1. Search for a domain = ```site: company.com```
2. Search for subdomains = ```site:*.company.com```
3. Search for certain terms in the URL = ```inurl: keyword```
    - Good for finding potentially sensitive files directory
4. Search within title = ```intitle: keyword```
5. Search for a file type = ```filetype: filetype``` |  Can look for pdfs,xlsx, zips
6. Find older versions of websites = `cache:company.com` | 
	- Older websites might have information like old email address etc
    - Another option is using the waybackmachine ([https://web.archive.org/](https://web.archive.org/)) to view older website
7. ** Specific vulnerability with some webservers** - Search for Directory listings = `intitle: index of`

Note: you can search a keyword while filtering out results from Google | eg. `site:ine.com employees`

##### Google Hacking Database

The Google Hacking Database (GHDB) also known as Google Dorks or Google Hacking, is a collection of advanced search queries and techniques to uncover hidden, vulnerable, or sensitive information that may be inadvertently exposed on the web. These can be helpful for coming up with creative queries where you could find things like credentials.

## theHarvester

theHarvester is a python tool which can collect emails and subdomains. This is pre-packaged in Kali linux but some of the services might need an API. <u>Double-check with the github page to see active services since the services can change</u>. 

- Github: https://github.com/laramies/theHarvester 

**General Syntax** - You need both the domain and specify the services you want to use for the search:

```
theHarvester -d website.com -b <services_separated by commas>
```

```
theHarvester -d company.com -b bing,anubis,crtsh

## HaveIBeenPwned

If you have some email addresses you can use a tool like HaveIbeenpwned ([https://haveibeenpwned.com/](https://haveibeenpwned.com/)) to see if the email address has been involved in a data breach. You can probably see if there a paste available (?) which means that there is a publicly available file that contained the info. You should be able to directly check the paste.
