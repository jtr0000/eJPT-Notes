#### Enumeration
Enumeration is the phase that follows host discovery and port scanning in a penetration test. In this step, the goal is to dig deeper and gather detailed information about the systems and services running on a network. This could include things likeâ€¦

- account names
- shared resources
- and misconfigured services.

Just like the scanning phase, enumeration makes active connections to the devices on the network.

Attackers typically target misconfigured or unnecessarily enabled protocols during enumeration. The purpose of this phase is to interact with these protocols, with the possibility of exploiting them in later stages of the test.
